# Kill Nickelback

In this exercise, you're going to use a conditional statements. Let's look at a basic example.

```ruby
nums = Array(1..10)
small_numbers = []

# Only add numbers to the new list if the value is less than 6
nums.each {|i| small_numbers.push(i) if i < 6}


words = ['big', 'red', 'dog', 'ate', 'his', 'food']
three_letters_words = []

# put the 3-letter words in the three_letter_words array using the shovel operator
for word in words
  if word.length ==3
    three_letters_words << word
  end
end
```

## Instructions

1. Define an array that contains arrays. Each array should contain two strings:
    1. The name of an artist
    1. A song by that artist

    Make sure that some of the songs are from the band Nickelback. You can see a [list of their greatest hits](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Nickelback-1/dp/B00FFERTUK/) on Amazon.
    ```
    songs = [
        ['Nickelback', 'How You Remind Me'],
        ['Will.i.am', 'That Power'],
        ['Miles Davis', 'Stella by Starlight'],
        ['Nickelback', 'Animals']
    ]
    ```
2. Using array manipulation methods, create a new array that contains all songs that were not performed by Nickelback.
